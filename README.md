# AtlasRH

AtlasRH is a Spring Boot REST API for human resources management. The project has grown from a simple department/employee backend into a more complete HR platform covering employee contracts, leave management, and leave approval workflows.

## What's new

The latest version of the project includes several major improvements:

- Contract management for employees with contract types: `CDI`, `CDD`, and `STAGE`
- Leave type management with annual leave allowance rules
- Leave request lifecycle: create, update, view, cancel, approve, and reject requests
- Manager-based approval workflow using `LeaveStatus` values such as `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, and `CANCELLED`
- Dedicated REST controllers for contracts and leave modules
- DTO-based responses and MapStruct mapping for cleaner API data transfer

## Overview

This application uses Java 17, Spring Boot 4.1.1, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, MapStruct, and Maven to expose HR operations through a REST API. It is designed as a backend foundation for a company or HR administration system.

## Core features

- Manage departments
- Register employees and assign them to a department
- Link an employee to a contract
- List and query available leave types
- Submit and track leave requests
- Approve or reject employee leave requests
- Persist HR data with JPA and PostgreSQL
- Expose clean API responses using DTOs

## Tech stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 4.1.1
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- MapStruct
- Lombok

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- A database named `atlasrhv1` or update the credentials in the configuration

## Configuration

The project configuration is defined in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

```properties
spring.application.name=AtlasRH

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/atlasrhv1
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=1996

spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

If your PostgreSQL setup is different, update the datasource URL, username, and password accordingly.

## Running the application

### With Maven

```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on the default Spring Boot port:
